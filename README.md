## Project Description

This is a game in which you play as a broke college student who needs to pay off their student loans. 
Unable to pay them off, you turn to the last resort - the casino. 
Play minigames such as blackjack, bingo, roulette, and slots, trying to work your way out of your troubling situation. 
If you make enough to pay off your debt, you win! If not, you lose, and you'll be working minumum wage forever.
